- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheShadoru but I am also known by a few other online handles.  I created this space to share past work and encourage collaboration toward solving large problems that cross into my areas of expertise.  I also intend to use this space to share briefings, code, models, white papers and materials from my past research and presentations at Security conferences. This will include past research and speaking engagements at DEFCON, BSIDES NoVA.
- 👀 I’m interested in OSINT, OPSEC, Security Research, Human Intelligence, Drones, Privacy, CTI, AI and Physical security ...
- 🌱 I’m currently researching data overlays for social media platforms based on OSINT Data and Private AI ...
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on any efforts that improve privacy for individuals, and reduce individual or national attack surface...
- 📫 I can be reached on Twitter @richwickersham
